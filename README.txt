A Guide To Python (Using BroCode's Online Guide to Python)

I have created this GitHub repository for those who want to learn Python or need a refresher's course on topics they might've forgotten about.
I followed the Bro Code Python Full Course for my practice, and for your guide.  I will also be providing in-depth examples and projects
to help learn Python.

There will be 2 folders for this guide:
- Python Lessons 
The Python Lessons are meant to be refreshers, or topics that are needed to learn.
- Python Projects 
The Python Projects will use the Python Lessons to enhance your understanding and how they can be used in a program.

Python Lessons in order:
1. Variable (variable_examples.py) #Includes print introduction and examples
2. Type Casting (typecasting_examples.py)
3. Input (input_examples.py)

Python Projects in order:
1. MadLibs Game: (Using Python Lessons 1-3)
